Privacy Policy

NicQuit ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application NicQuit ("the App").

1. Information We Collect

When you use NicQuit, we may collect the following types of data:
• Personal Information: Email address, login credentials, and other data required for authentication (stored securely via Firebase Authentication).
• Usage Data: Anonymous data about how the app is used, such as frequency of app opens, feature interactions, and progress tracking (used to improve user experience).
• Device Information: Device model, operating system version, and unique identifiers for analytics purposes.
• Chat Data: Messages exchanged via the random chat feature are temporarily stored on Firebase Realtime Database. NicQuit does not manually monitor or moderate conversations.

2. How We Use Your Information

• To provide account authentication and maintain user sessions.
• To save your progress, stats, and addiction recovery history.
• To display estimated health recovery statistics (based on general research averages, not medical advice).
• To connect you with other users anonymously in random chat.
• To display personalized motivational quotes and ads.
• To improve and update app features and services.

3. Advertising and Analytics

NicQuit may show third-party advertisements through Admob. These ads help support app development and maintenance. Third-party ad networks may collect limited data (such as device identifiers) to deliver relevant ads.  
You can manage your ad preferences through your device settings.
We may also use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports and app performance data. This helps us improve stability and user experience. No personal messages or private data are read or used for analytics.

4. Data Storage and Security

Your data is securely stored in Firebase servers managed by Google. We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your information.

5. User Responsibility and Disclaimer

NicQuit provides tools and motivation for users who wish to quit nicotine. However, we are not a medical or therapeutic service. The app’s recommendations (including health recovery statistics, life regained/lost estimates, and withdrawal management tips) are based on general research and should not be taken as medical advice.  
We are not responsible for any outcomes or damages resulting from the use or misuse of this app. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.
Users are responsible for their own messages in the chat feature. NicQuit does not actively monitor conversations and is not responsible for user-generated content.
6. Children’s Privacy

NicQuit is not directed toward users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we discover that such data has been collected, it will be promptly deleted.
7. Data Retention and Deletion

User progress and profile data are retained for as long as your account is active. You can delete your data anytime by using the “Delete Account” option within the app, which removes all user-related data from Firebase.
8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Users will be notified within the app when major changes occur. Continued use of NicQuit after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
9. Data Sharing & Sale
We do not sell your personal data to any third parties. Data may only be shared with trusted services used within the app such as Firebase and AdMob for core functionality and advertising.
10. Third-Party Services
This app uses Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, and Google AdMob. These services may process data according to their own privacy policies.
